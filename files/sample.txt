Hey,

I’m Max Shapira - a Python developer who rises early to code, exercise, and read before my two
little ones take over the house. I started coding in 2020 as an entrepreneur and
learned along the way. While I may not have “5 years of experience,” I bring
resilience, diligence, and dedication to problem-solving.
To this day, I have worked with a range of technologies and frameworks. Web
development? I used Django, JavaScript, CSS, PostgreSQL, and MongoDB. Have I
needed an API? FastAPI was my best ally. If the project required a more serious
approach—I picked Docker, RabbitMQ, and GitHub Actions. My experience also
includes working with LLMs using LangChain and Streamlit to build custom
services and autonomous agents. In my current role, I'm diving deep into serverless
architecture, leveraging AWS and SST to build and maintain a robust email API
service. On top of that, I'm using Cloudflare Workers and TypeScript to develop
custom API solutions for retroactive updates to our user database, allowing Direct
Marketers to send more targeted and effective newsletters.
My GitHub profile summary is included below if your company is looking for a
Backend Developer to grow with the team and deliver top-notch results.
