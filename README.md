# WispGPT - your personal AI sidekick

Wisp is an AI-powered personal assistant that empowers users by helping them understand documents, websites, meetings, and more.

The project consists of six main components, each focused on a different use case:

- DocumentGPT boils down long texts for you. It spots key info and themes and sums things up nicely.

- PrivateGPT does the same for your confidential stuff. It keeps things secure while picking out what matters.

- QuizGPT helps you learn by whipping up custom quizzes on any topic. It's a snap way to reinforce what you pick up.

- SiteGPT cuts through the clutter on websites. It zones in on the meaty details, so you don't have to.

- MeetingGPT takes the hassle out of meetings. It provides summaries and can even answer questions about what happened.

- InvestorGPT gives the lowdown on companies. It serves up financial analysis and news to inform your investing choices.

The aim is to put some real AI muscle behind your productivity. Wisp handles the heavy lifting so you can focus on what\'s important to you.
